       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='\\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and fellow citizens, I am honored to be speaking with you today about a topic that is near and dear to my heart: democracy. Democracy is a system of government that has been the foundation of many great nations throughout history, and it is a system that I believe is essential for the well-being and prosperity of our society.\\n\\nAt its core, democracy is about giving power to the people. It is about empowering citizens to have a say in how they are governed, and ensuring that their voices are heard. This is why democracy is often referred to as a \"government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" It is a system that recognizes the inherent value and dignity of every individual, and seeks to create a society where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and contribute.\\n\\nBut democracy is not just about giving power to the people. It is also about creating a framework of rules and institutions that ensure this power is used responsibly and for the greater good. In a democratic system, citizens have the right to vote for their leaders, to hold them accountable for their actions, and to participate in the decision-making process. This helps to prevent abuses of power and ensures that government is transparent and accountable to the people.\\n\\nOf course, no political system is perfect, and democracy is no exception. There are many challenges and criticisms that have been leveled against democracy over the years. Some argue that it can be slow and inefficient, that it can lead to gridlock and polarization, and that it can sometimes result in the election of leaders who are not truly representative of the people\\'s will.\\n\\nHowever, I believe that these challenges are outweighed by the benefits of democracy. For one thing, democracy provides a mechanism for citizens to have a voice in how they are governed, and to hold their leaders accountable for their actions. This helps to ensure that government is responsive to the needs and concerns of the people, and that it serves the greater good.\\n\\nMoreover, democracy fosters a sense of community and civic engagement, which is essential for building strong and healthy societies. When citizens are actively involved in the political process, they are more likely to feel invested in their communities and to work together towards common goals. This can help to build bridges between different groups and to promote social cohesion and cooperation.\\n\\nFinally, democracy is a system that values diversity and inclusivity. It recognizes that citizens have different perspectives and beliefs, and seeks to create a space where everyone can participate and have their voices heard. This helps to ensure that government is representative of the diverse populations it serves, and that no one group or individual has too much power or influence.\\n\\nIn conclusion, democracy is a system of government that is essential for building strong and healthy societies. It provides citizens with a voice in how they are governed, ensures that government is transparent and accountable, and fosters a sense of community and civic engagement. While no political system is perfect, I believe that the benefits of democracy far outweigh its challenges, and that it remains the best form of government for promoting the well-being and prosperity of our society. Thank you.')]"

The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al.[4] It is considered a foundational[5] paper in modern artificial intelligence, and a main contributor to the AI boom, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of a wide variety of AI, such as large language models.[6][7] At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal generative AI.[1]\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.[8]\\nAs of 2025,[update] the paper has been cited more than 173,000 times, placing it among the top ten most-cited papers of the 21st century.[9] After the paper was published by Google, each of the authors left the company to join other companies or to found startups.\\n\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\nThe authors of the paper are: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. All eight authors were \"equal contributors\" to the paper; the listed order was randomized (according to the paper itself). After the paper, each of the authors left Google to join other companies or to found startups.[10][11]\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles.[12] The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.[8] An early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers franchise. The team was named Team Transformer.[12]\\n\\nMethods discussed and introduced[edit]\\nThe paper is most well known for the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which forms the underlying architecture for most forms of modern large language models (LLMs). A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained.\\nThe following mechanisms were introduced by the paper as part of the development of the transformer architecture.\\nScaled dot-product attention & self-attention\\nThe use of the scaled dot-product attention and self-attention mechanism instead of a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory (which rely on recurrence instead) allow for better performance as described in the following paragraph. The paper described the scaled dot-product attention as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\nt\\nt\\ne\\nn\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n\\n\\n(\\nQ\\n,\\nK\\n,\\nV\\n)\\n:=\\n\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n×\\n\\nK\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n×\\nV\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\rm {Attention}}(Q,K,V):={\\\\rm {softmax}}\\\\left({\\\\frac {Q\\\\times K^{T}}{\\\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}\\\\right)\\\\times V}\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle Q}\\n\\n, \\n\\n\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle K}\\n\\n, \\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle V}\\n\\n are respectively the query, key, value matrices, and  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{k}}\\n\\n is the dimension of the values.\\nSince the model relies on Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V) matrices that come from the same source (i.e. the input sequence or context window), this eliminates the need for RNNs completely ensuring parallelizability for the architecture. This differs from the original form of the Attention mechanism introduced in 2014. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of an additional scaling factor that was found to be most effective with respect to the dimension of the key vectors (represented as \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{k}}\\n\\n and initially set to 64 within the paper) in the manner shown above.\\nIn the specific context of translation which the paper focused on, the Query and Key matrices are usually represented in embeddings corresponding to the source language while the Value matrix corresponds to the target language.\\nMulti-head attention\\nIn the self-attention mechanism, queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) are dynamically generated for each input sequence (limited typically by the size of the context window), allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different steps. Multi-head attention enhances this process by introducing multiple parallel attention heads. Each attention head learns different linear projections of the Q, K, and V matrices. This allows the model to capture different aspects of the relationships between words in the sequence simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single aspect.\\nBy doing this, multi-head attention ensures that the input embeddings are updated from a more varied and diverse set of perspectives. After the attention outputs from all heads are calculated, they are concatenated and passed through a final linear transformation to generate the output.\\nPositional encoding\\nSince the Transformer model is not a seq2seq model and does not rely on the sequence of the text in order to perform encoding and decoding, the paper relied on the use of sine and cosine wave functions to encode the position of the token into the embedding. The methods introduced in the paper are discussed below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP\\n\\nE\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\np\\no\\ns\\n\\n\\n,\\n2\\ni\\n)\\n\\n\\n=\\nsin\\n\\u2061\\n(\\n\\n\\np\\no\\ns\\n\\n\\n\\n/\\n\\n\\n\\n10000\\n\\n\\n2\\ni\\n\\n/\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\nm\\no\\nd\\ne\\nl\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle PE_{({\\\\rm {pos}},2i)}=\\\\sin({\\\\rm {pos}}/{10000}^{2i/d_{\\\\rm {model}}})}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP\\n\\nE\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\np\\no\\ns\\n\\n\\n,\\n2\\ni\\n+\\n1\\n)\\n\\n\\n=\\ncos\\n\\u2061\\n(\\n\\n\\np\\no\\ns\\n\\n\\n\\n/\\n\\n\\n\\n10000\\n\\n\\n2\\ni\\n\\n/\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\nm\\no\\nd\\ne\\nl\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle PE_{({\\\\rm {pos}},2i+1)}=\\\\cos({\\\\rm {pos}}/{10000}^{2i/d_{\\\\rm {model}}})}\\n\\n\\nwherein \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\np\\no\\ns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\rm {pos}}}\\n\\n, \\n\\n\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle i}\\n\\n, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\nm\\no\\nd\\ne\\nl\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {d_{\\\\rm {model}}}}\\n\\n correspond to the position of the word, the current dimension index and the dimension of the model respectively. The sine function is used for even indices of the embedding while the cosine function is used for odd indices. The resultant \\n\\n\\n\\nP\\nE\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle PE}\\n\\n embedding is then added to the word at that corresponding position with respect to the current context window. The paper specifically comments on why this method was chosen describing:\\n\"We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\"[1]\\n\\nHistorical context[edit]\\nMain articles: Transformer (deep learning architecture) §\\xa0History, and Seq2seq §\\xa0History\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\n Predecessors[edit]\\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model\\'s state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995),[note 1] an RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units.[13] Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks[14] or higher-order networks.[15] LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of transformers. However, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs.[note 2] Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence.\\nModern transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window. The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns to compute a weight matrix for further processing depending on the input.[16] One of its two networks has \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981).[17][18][19] A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries.[16] This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear transformer.[20][21]\\n\\n Attention with seq2seq[edit]\\nMain article: Seq2seq §\\xa0History\\nThe idea of encoder–decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s; commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.[22][23]\\nA 380M-parameter model for machine translation uses two long short-term memories (LSTM).[23] Its architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, another 130M-parameter model used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM.[22] Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.[24][25]\\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved. This is because the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which is then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, degrading the output. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.[26]\\nThe RNN search model introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of the fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. The name is because it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".[4]\\nThe relative performances were compared between global (that of RNN search) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, finding that mixed attention had higher quality than global attention, while local attention reduced translation time.[27]\\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM.[28] It took nine months to develop, and it outperformed the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.[29]\\n\\n Parallelizing attention[edit]\\nMain article: Attention (machine learning) §\\xa0History\\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs.[30] One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence would be sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\".[31] That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom at the time, and even his father Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical.[31] In the same year, self-attention (called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention) was proposed for LSTMs.[32]\\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder–decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance.[1] This led to the introduction of a multi-head attention model that was easier to parallelize due to the use of independent heads and the lack of recurrence. Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.[33]\\n\\n\\n AI boom era[edit]\\nAs early as spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles.[34] Transformer architecture is now used alongside many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only transformer model.[35] In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries.[36] In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder–RNN-decoder model by a transformer-encoder–RNN-decoder model.[37]\\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly[38] popular, triggering a boom around large language models.[39][40]\\nSince 2020, transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer,[41] speech recognition,[42] robotics,[43] and multimodal.[44] The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks.[45] Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024),[46] and Sora (2024), use transformers to analyse input data (like text prompts) by breaking it down into \"tokens\" and then calculating the relevance between each token using self-attention, which helps the model understand the context and relationships within the data.\\n\\nTraining[edit]\\nWhile the primary focus of the paper at the time was to improve machine translation, the paper also discussed the use of the architecture on English Constituency Parsing, both with limited and large-sized datasets, achieving a high-score without specific tuning for the task indicating the promising nature of the model for use in a wide-variety of general purpose of seq2seq tasks.\\nDataset\\nThe English-to-German translation model was trained on the 2014 WMT (Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation) English-German dataset, consisting of nearly 4.5 million sentences derived from TED Talks and high-quality news articles. A separate translation model was trained on the much larger 2014 WMT English-French dataset, consisting of 36 million sentences. Both datasets were encoded with byte-pair encoding.\\nHardware\\nThe models were trained using 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. The base models were trained for 100,000 steps and the big models were trained for 300,000 steps - each step taking about 0.4 seconds to complete for the base models and 1.0 seconds for the big models. The base model trained for a total of 12 hours, and the big model trained for a total of 3.5 days. Both the base and big models outperforms the 2017 state-of-the-art in both English-German and English-French while achieving the comparatively lowest training cost.[1] The estimated computing cost was 0.089 petaFLOP/s–days.[47]\\nHyperparameters and regularization\\nFor their 100M-parameter Transformer model, the authors increased the learning rate linearly for the first 4000 (warmup) steps and decreased it proportionally to inverse square root of the current step number. Dropout layers were applied to the output of each sub-layer before normalization, the sums of the embeddings, and the positional encodings. The dropout rate was set to 0.1. Label smoothing was applied with a value of 0.1 which \"improves accuracy and BLEU score\".[1]\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Gated recurrent units (2014) further reduced its complexity.\\n\\n^ Some architectures, such as RWKV or state space models, avoid the issue.\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ a b c d e f Vaswani, Ashish; Shazeer, Noam; Parmar, Niki; Uszkoreit, Jakob; Jones, Llion; Gomez, Aidan N; Kaiser, Łukasz; Polosukhin, Illia (December 2017). \"Attention is All you Need\" (PDF).

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.
